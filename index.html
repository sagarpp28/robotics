    <h1>What is Robotics</h1>
    <p><strong>Robotics</strong> is a branch of engineering that involves the conception,design,manufacture and operation of robotics. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in variety of ways. </p>
    <p>Robotics can take on a number of forms. A robot may ressemble be a human,or it may be in the form of a robotic application,such as robotic process automation <span style="color: blue
    ;">(RPA</span>). Which simulates how humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules based tasks.</p>
    <p>While the field of robotics and exploration of the potential uses and functionally of robots have grown substantially in the 20th century, the idea is certainly not a new one.</p>

    <h2>History of robotics</h2>
    <p>The term robotics is an extention of the word robot. One of its first uses came from Czech writer Karel Capek, who used the word in his play, Rossum's Universsal Robots, in 1920</p>
    <p>However it is science fiction author <strong><em>Isaac Asimoov</em></strong> who has been given credit for being the first person to use the term in the 1940s by Oxford English Dictionary. </p>
    <p>In Assimiv's story, he suggested three principlestoguide the behaviour of autonomous robots and smart machines.</p>
    <p>Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics have survived to the present:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Robots must never harm humans</li>
        <li>Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1</li>
        <li>Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rule</li>
    </ol>
